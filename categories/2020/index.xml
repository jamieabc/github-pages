      <description>Recently I have done raising unit tests coverage rate of 2 packages to at least 80%. Of course, high coverage rate isn&amp;rsquo;t always a gold standard to achieve, and some corner conditions are not necessray to test, so 80% seems a number that tries to demonstrate most code paths are testable.
These 2 packges with 0% and 20% unit test coverate rate at the time I started to modify. After some refactoring, both packages&amp;rsquo; coverage rate reaches 80%.</description>
