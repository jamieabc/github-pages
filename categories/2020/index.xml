      <description>Recently I am trying to increase 2 packges unit test coverage rate to at least 70%. Of course, high coverage rate isn&amp;rsquo;t always correct, some corner conditions are not necessray to test, so 70 is just a number that tries to say most critical statement are well-tested.
These 2 packges with 0% and 20% unit test coverate rate at the time I am trying to modify. After some refactoring, coverage rate reaches 80% and 78% respectively.</description>
